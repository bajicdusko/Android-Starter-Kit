# Android Starter Kit

More or less, each android project could have similar structure and libraries used. Some features as well. This project should help us start new android application without spending too much time on initial setup.
Project is organized with **Clean Architecture** and **MVP Pattern** in mind, separated to four modules: 
* app
* presentation
* data
* domain
